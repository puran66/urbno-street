# URGENT: File Corruption Issue

## ⚠️ Problem
The `app/page.tsx` file has become corrupted during the last edit with duplicate code and syntax errors.

## 🔧 Solution

### Option 1: Restore from Git (Recommended)
```bash
git checkout app/page.tsx
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix
The file needs to be cleaned up - there's duplicate hero section code starting around line 747.

## 📝 What We Were Trying to Do

### 1. Premium Hero Section
- Mesh gradient backgrounds
- Glassmorphism effects
- Floating badges with glow
- **Fixed visible buttons** (desktop + mobile sticky)
- Better typography and spacing

### 2. Reels Section
- Add left/right scroll buttons
- Keep auto-scroll
- Professional controls

### 3. Winter Collection
- Complete redesign
- Premium countdown
- Better visuals

## 🚀 Quick Recovery Steps

1. **Restore the file**:
   ```bash
   git checkout app/page.tsx
   ```

2. **Or restart from last working version**

3. **Then I can apply the improvements properly**

## 💡 What Needs to Be Done

Once file is restored:
1. ✅ Create truly premium hero (mesh gradients, glassmorphism)
2. ✅ Fix button visibility (sticky on mobile)
3. ✅ Add scroll buttons to reels
4. ✅ Redesign winter countdown

Let me know when you've restored the file and I'll apply all improvements correctly!
